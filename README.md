# about
Monkey-type is a minimalistic typing test, featuring many test modes, an account system to save your typing speed history and user configurable features like themes, a smooth caret and more.

# keybinds
You can use `tab` and `enter` (or just `tab` if you have quick tab mode enabled) to restart the typing test. Open the command line by pressing `esc` - there you can access all the functionality you need without touching your mouse. 

# stats
- wpm - total amount of characters in the correctly typed words, divided by 5
- acc - percentage of correctly pressed keys
- key - correct characters / incorrect characters. Calculated after the test has ended

# bug report or feature request
If you encounter a bug, or have a feature request - send me a message on Reddit, create an issue on GitHub or send me a message using the command line `esc`.
