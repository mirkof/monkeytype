      "text": "\"Our research suggests that ultra-clean, ultra-hygienic environments early in life may contribute to higher levels of inflammation as an adult, which in turn increases risks for a wide range of diseases,\" states Thomas McDade, associate professor at Northwestern University, Illinois, U.S.A. In a study that compared Filipino children with their American counterparts, it was found that, overall, the Filipinos suffered many more infectious diseases as youngsters. Yet, contrary to expectations, young Filipino adults had much lower blood levels of C-reactive protein, the concentration of which rises in response to inflammation. The conclusion? Greater childhood exposure to common bacteria may actually protect adults from deadly illnesses.",
