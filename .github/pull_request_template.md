Adding a language or a theme? For languages, make sure to edit the `_list.json`, `_groups.json` files, and add the `language.json` file as well. For themes, make sure to add the `theme.css` file. It will not work if you don't follow these steps!

Please reference any issues and or PRs related to your pull request.

If your change is visual (mainly themes) it would be extra awesome if you could include a screenshot.
