## Building and Running

1. Run `npm ci` in the project root directory to install dependencies.
1. Run `npm run start:dev` to start a local dev server on port 5000. It will watch for changes and rebuild when you edit files in `src/` or `public/`. Use ctrl+c to stop it.

## Standards and Conventions

1. Code style is enforced by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html), which is automatically ran every time you `git commit` (if you've followed the above instructions properly).
